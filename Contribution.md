2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine.
3. Create a new branch for your contribution:
   - Branch names should be descriptive, indicating the purpose of your changes.
   - Use hyphens to separate words in branch names (e.g., `feature-add-new-feature`).
4. Make your changes and commit them with clear, concise, and meaningful commit messages.
5. Push your branch to your forked repository on GitHub.

## Code Quality and Best Practices

2. Provide a descriptive title and detailed description of your changes in the PR.
3. Reference any relevant issues or related pull requests in the description.
4. Include any necessary documentation updates with your changes.
5. Ensure that the PR only includes the commits related to your changes (rebase if necessary).
